call    virtual addr (text section)

1) calculate the addr of next instruction 
    addr of next instruction    =   addr of current instruction + 
                                    size of current instruction 
                                =   eip + size of current instruction 
2)  push the address of next instruction calculated in step 1 
    on auto-storage section 

3)  set eip to virtual addr (specified in operand of call instruction)
