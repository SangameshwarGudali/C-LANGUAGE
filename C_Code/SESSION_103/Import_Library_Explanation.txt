# cl MessageBoxDemo.c [user32.lib] --> will not be required! 

Question: Why is it required in the first place? 

Answer: 

In C source code, we call many functions whose 
definitions are not written by us. 

To make such calls work, we must include the header 
file containing the declarations of such functions so 
that the compiler can find declarations before call. 

Eventually, the definitions must also be supplied to 
the linker. The definitions are present in binary files 
known as libraries. 

Libraries come in two flavours 
1) static link library 
2) dynamic link library 

static link library can be linked with application 
at the time of compilation 

dynamic link library can be loaded into running process! 

If xyz is a name of library then 

static link library gets extension '.lib'
and xyz.lib is the full name of the static link library 

If xyz is a dyanamic link library then its extension in 
.dll. Therefore the full name of library is xyz.dll

IMPORT LIBRARY.
