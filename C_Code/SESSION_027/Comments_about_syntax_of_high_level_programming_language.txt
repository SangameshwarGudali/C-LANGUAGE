Aim:    The syntax(grammar) of a language should be such that 
        expressing a desired computation should be intuitive!

PROCESS: 
[0] Program source code should be made of up of statements 
    OR 
    Basic unit of reading / developing the source code should be 
    statement (much as we find in case of natural languages)
[1] Dedicated statements to reserve data (Data Definition Statements)
[2] Express computation on reserved data (Compute Statements)
