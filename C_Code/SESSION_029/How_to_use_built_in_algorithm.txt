How to use exit algorithm in my program? 

Step 1: You must write algorithm name, algorithm input element(s) type, 
        algorithm output element type 
        [This is known as TYPE DECLARATION of algorithm] 
        void exit(int); 

Step 2: 
    int main(void)
    {

        exit(0);    // CALL / USE OF AN ALGORITHM
    }

// CALL TO AN ALGORITHM / USE OF AN ALGORITHM is a COMPUTE STATEMENT
