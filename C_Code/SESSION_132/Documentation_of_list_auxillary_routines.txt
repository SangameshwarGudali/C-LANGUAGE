void generic_insert(node_t* p_beg, node_t* p_mid, node_t* p_end); 
Precondition:   p_beg->next == p_end 
                p_end->prev == p_beg 
                p_mid is a newly allocated node 

Goal: to insert node pointed by p_mid between nodes 
    pointed by p_beg and p_end resp. 


void generic_delete(node_t* p_delete_node); 
Precondition: 
    p_delete_node points to a non-DUMMY (non head node)
    in some list 
Postcondition: 
    Node pointed p_delete_node is no longer a part of list 
    but remaining nodes are chained in linked list 

node_t* search_node(list_t* p_list, data_t s_data); 
node_t* get_node(data_t new_data);
